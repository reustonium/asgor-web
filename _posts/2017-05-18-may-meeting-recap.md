We talked about our "Hooray Moments" from the last year. Something we were proud of or an accomplishment. It was wonderful to hear the successes that this group has accomplished!

Barb shared the poem, Life, by Egar Guest that she modified. She substituted "speech" for "life" and this is the result.....

>"Speech is a gift to be used every day.
Not to be smothered and hidden away;
It isn't a thing to be stored in the chest
Where you gather your keepsakes and treasure your best;
It isn't a joy to be sipped now and then
And promptly put back in a dark place again.

>Speech is a gift that the humblest may boast of 
And one that the humblest may well make the most of.
Get out and speak each hour of the day;
Wear it and use it as much as you may;
Don't keep it in niches and corners and grooves.
You'll find that in service its beauty improves"

Thank you to everyone who helps make this group possible.
