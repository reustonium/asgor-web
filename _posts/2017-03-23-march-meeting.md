title: March 2017 Meeting Recap
---
**Saturday April 22** is the Rochester Heart Walk and Run. The walk starts at 9:00 at Frontier Field. If you are interested in doing the walk with our group, please send me an email and let me know as soon as possible. You can check it out here: http://www2.heart.org/site/TR/HeartWalk/FDA-FoundersAffiliate?pg=entry&fr_id=2106

**Saturday May 20 from 12-2pm** is the Open House to learn about Pickleball at the Perinton Community Center. This is a great sport that people of all ages and all abilities can play. You can even play it from a wheelchair or a regular seated chair. Please email me if you are interested in attending and I will provide more information. I thought it might be fun to go as a group if people were interested.

On **June 10 and 11** you can try out adaptive cycling and paddling through Rochester Accessible Adventures. If you are interested, please let me know and I will put you in contact with Anita O'Brien from Rochester Accessible Adventures. 

Anita O'Brien from Rochester Accessible Adventures spoke to our group and gave a lovely presentation. A lot of the information she discussed can be found on her website: https://rochesteraccessibleadventures.org/.
